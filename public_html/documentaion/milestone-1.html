    <p><li> <large>Purpose</large>: My PWP will be a professional portfolio showcasing my front-end web development skills that I cultivated over time with the bootcamp.

I also plan to show my more personable side which will includes my hobbies and other passions as well as my dog, Penelope.</li></p>

<p><li> <large>Audience</large>: My site will be designed for people who work in web development and other software engineering careers. More specifically, to catch the interest of tech hiring managers, recruiting officers, senior/lead web developers, and my peers.</li></p>

<p><li><large>Goal</large>: The main goal of my site is to showcase the hard-skills that I developed over time in the bootcamp in an effort to network with other developers, get my name/personal project out there in the web developer community and send out forms of contact so that I will be considered for employment opportunity. My secondary goal is to portray who I am outside of work.</li></p>
